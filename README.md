# Coding Challenge

### Basic Usage
1. Download the source code and start the project using `node server.js`. From there going to `localhost:3000` should work.
2. The only thing that might be a bit different is that I moved the edit button to be per row instead of all
employees at once at the bottom. The prompt made it seem like updating many employees at once was not the intention so that's
why I moved it
3. Editing employees is done inline. The `Edit Employee` button acts as a save button to save the inline edits.
### Final Thoughts
- I chose to use Jquery on the frontend out of comfort even though it's a bit outdated nowadays. Ideally should be something like React 
- The UI should be styled much more but for the sake of time, most of it is default.
- Thanks for the challenge!
